SPT LEADERBOARD - LEGAL AGREEMENT / TERMS OF SERVICE (LA/TOS)
============================================================

By submitting your statistics to the SPT Leaderboard, you agree to comply with the following Terms of Service.
Violations may lead to removal from the leaderboard, profile bans, or permanent bans.


1. GENERAL RULES
----------------
1.1. Fair Play:
     Any form of cheating, exploiting, or deception via mods is strictly forbidden.
     This includes manipulation of crucial game data (PMC/SCAV level, Quests, HP, Hydration, Energy),
     as well as "double armoring" (wearing armor on top of other armor).
     The presence of unofficial modifications may result in investigation and a temporary ban.
     If proof of legitimacy is not provided on appeal, a permanent ban will follow.

1.2. Casual Mode:
     Gameplay-altering mods are allowed in Casual Mode, but exploits or harm to the leaderboard are not.
     Casual Mode statistics are not eligible for the main leaderboard.

1.3. Allowed Mods:
     Cosmetic, weapon, AI, and quality-of-life (QoL) mods are allowed.
     Gameplay-altering mods (e.g. god mode, unlimited ammo, faster reload, additional loot, radars, revivals, debug mods,
     quieter environments, or unrestricted armor/headwear) are forbidden.

1.4. Profile Standing:
     Profiles flagged for suspicious activity or abnormal statistics may be banned with no right to appeal.

1.5. Content Guidelines:
     Usernames, profile pictures, and "About Me" sections must remain appropriate for all audiences.
     Offensive, discriminatory, hateful, sexually explicit, or politically charged content is prohibited.
     Political or extremist material of any kind will result in permanent restriction or ban.

1.6. Acknowledgment of Rules:
     Participation implies full acceptance of LA/TOS terms.
     Failure to review updates does not exempt from compliance.


2. ELIGIBILITY & PARTICIPATION
------------------------------
2.1. Mod Policy:
     Any mod providing a competitive or statistical advantage is prohibited and will result in disqualification or ban.

2.2. Multi-Account Policy:
     Multiple linked accounts are allowed, but all share responsibility.
     Violations on any account may result in sanctions for the entire group.

2.3. Honesty:
     All submitted statistics must reflect genuine gameplay.
     Falsified or edited data will result in permanent ban.

2.4. Account Responsibility:
     You are solely responsible for actions under your profile or token.
     Do not share your token or account credentials.


3. DATA USAGE & RIGHTS
----------------------
3.1. Public Display:
     By submitting data, you grant SPT Leaderboard a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use,
     display, and store your statistics publicly.

3.2. Privacy & Data Collection:
     To prevent exploits, hashed/obfuscated IPs may be temporarily collected (max. 1 hour).
     Only malicious IPs are retained long-term. Raw IPs are never logged.

3.3. Moderation:
     Administration reserves the right to review, modify, or remove entries at any time.
     Developers may adjust scoring, seasons, or resets as needed.
     All moderation decisions are final.

3.4. Policy Updates:
     These Terms may be updated anytime. Continued use of the service implies acceptance.

3.5. Data Anonymity:
     Submitted data contains only gameplay statistics and user-generated IDs.
     No PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is collected.
     All data becomes part of a permanent, immutable leaderboard record.


4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY & DISCLAIMER
--------------------------------------
4.1. Service "As Is":
     The SPT Leaderboard is provided as-is and as-available, without warranties of any kind.

4.2. No Liability:
     To the fullest extent of the law, SPT Leaderboard Team, developers, and moderators are not liable
     for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including data loss or server interruptions.

4.3. Termination of Service:
     The Team reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the service at any time
     without notice or liability.
